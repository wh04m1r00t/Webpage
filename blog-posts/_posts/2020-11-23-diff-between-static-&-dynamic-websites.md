**Static websites** are basically pure **HTML** files with additional **JavaScript** and **CSS** files to make the page more colorful and dynamic in the **browser**. But what the browser downloads from the **server** is pure file-based.

In **Dynamic websites**, there are no **HTML files** but the HTML is generated on the **fly** by the **server** by executing some code that generates the HTML. This HTML generating code can be written in **Python, PHP, ASP .NET, ColdFusion, Java, C++** or any other programming language. And this is why it's called Dynamic as the HTML generating code can create **custom HTML** for every **visitor** and every visit, while **Static HTML** will be the same for all visitors.

Both can be **responsive sites**, though. And, they can both call the **JavaScript** & can change the **content of page** at the browser. Some sites can even mix both **Static & Dynamic pages**, if needed.

Many HTML generating code will contain some **HTML templates** inside with **additional markup** indicating where the server will have to fill in some content. But there are some **JavaScript libraries** that will do this inside the browser so Static and Dynamic Sites can look extremely similar.
