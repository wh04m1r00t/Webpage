Hey lads, so today we're going to have an interesting discussion on a very unique structure. Recently, I was working on [**Optimizing Vector**](https://hypertextassassin0273.github.io/blog-posts/2021-03-25-optimized-minimal-custom-vector-container) & like any other container, it has some cons, which I wanted to overcome by changing its internals. Thus, in process, I developed a new structure named as [**Forward Deque**](https://github.com/HypertextAssassin0273/Data_Structures_in_Cpp/blob/main/Native_Data_Structures/Contiguous_Structures/Forward_Deque.hpp). Now, before we dive into specifics of this stucture, it's better to discuss the background & so, we'll start with the drawbacks of **Vector** container.

Since, Vector internally uses a **dynamically allocated array** to store its elements, it performs **reallocation process** in order to grow in size when new elements are inserted. But, it also costs us two major issues:

1. **invalidates pointers** & **references** to elements as they no longer point to stored elements at **new memory addresses** (this also makes Vector harder to be directly used as container for storing dependant resources in complex projects).
2. takes **O(N)** complexity of time to reallocate previously assigned resources (which isn't good performance wise when there are **constant** amount of **push_backs** & the **capacity** isn't **reserved** in Vector).

So, after alot of research, I found **STL::Deque** structure can overcome these above stated issues. But the problem was that its current **internal implementation** is very heavy & costly as compare to the work we want to do as Vector container. It's like killing a fly with nuke. So, I came up with with a hybrid solution by simply taking the minimal approach of STL::Deque & named the structure as Forward_Deque (as it justifies the sense of **one-sided deque** since it only performs **push_backs** & **pop_backs**, similar to Vector).

The internal implementation of Forward_Deque is pretty simple. I've implemented it as Vector of Vectors, which **theoretically** behaves similar to **dynamically allocated 2D array**. As yet, if you recall the dynamic 2D arrays, they're simply **dynamic array of pointers** pointing to **dynamic 1D arrays**. Now, here comes the fun bit, storing your elements **linearly** in this specific composition gives you an advantage over the stored elements in Vector or dynamic 1D array. The **external** pointers & references pointing to elements in 1D arrays are not invalidated on reallocation of main array of pointers. This gives us another advantage & overcomes our (2nd above stated) reallocation problem. The realloation process will give us **Geometric** (rather than **Arithmetic**) **progression** in terms of **time complexity**, if we **ideally** fix the capacity of 1D array. To understand this, lets take an example in next paragraph.

Say, we fixed the capacity of **chunk** (1D array) for 8 elements. On our first push_back, it will first allocate a new chunk to main **array of pointers** and then store the provided element in 1st position of chunk. Afterwards, for rest 7 left positions in the chunk, it will directly place the elements one by one. Now, on inserting our 9th element, a reallocation in main array will occur & the 9th element will be stored in 1st position of newly allocated chunk & the next 7 elements will be stored directly in (current) 2nd chunk. But intriguingly, this reallocation in main array will not change the address of our previously stored elements in 1st chunk. Since, reallocation of main array will only **copy pointer or base address** of previous chunk. Hence, in general, making the complexity time a **Geometric progression** which is way better than **O(N)** amount of time for reallocation.

Now, for the **accessing** part, it takes **O(1)** complexity time since we have **fixed size of chunks**, which makes it possible for us to easily get the current index of element (by performing some arithmetic calculations). Hence, making it a true **contiguous** or **sequence container**.

**Note:** This container is only offered in **C++11 & higher versions** since its performance heavily relies on [**move semantics**](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/c-rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-beginners).

**P.S:** This implementation can easily become more **memory-efficient** by making it a **vector of fixed-size dynamic arrays** with only **size** attribute instead of taking **vector of vectors** as we don't need **capacity** attribute for our 1D Vector.
