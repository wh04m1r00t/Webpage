We all know how **dynamic** variables & objects work & can be destroyed after utilizing them (i.e. by using **delete** keyword). But ever wondered how **automatic** (normal) variables & objects can be destroyed after utilizing them?

Well it's simple. Since, their **life-span** depends on the **scope**. So, you can define them inside that scope (i.e. by simply using a **pair of parenthesis**) & they will be destroyed after the program jumps out of that scope.

This technique comes very handy when your program contains too many automatic variables & their use is very short in the entire program.

**P.S:** Below is the attached **Source Code** which elaborates this concept more deeply. Run its **.exe** file & then compare the output with code to understand thoroughly. Hope you guys like it. Peace!!!
